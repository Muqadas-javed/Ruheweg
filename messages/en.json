        "question": "What should I do immediately after a loved one passes away?",
        "answer": "First, contact emergency services if needed, then reach out to me. I'm available 24/7 and will guide you through every step, including obtaining the death certificate, arranging transportation, and beginning funeral planning."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How much do funeral services typically cost?",
        "answer": "Costs vary based on the type of service and personal preferences. I offer transparent pricing and will provide a detailed estimate during our consultation. I also offer flexible payment options to ease financial concerns."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What is the difference between burial and cremation?",
        "answer": "Burial involves placing the body in a casket in a cemetery plot. Cremation reduces the body to ashes, which can be kept in an urn, scattered, or placed in a columbarium. Both options can include a full memorial service."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How long does it take to arrange a funeral?",
        "answer": "Typically, a funeral can be arranged within 3-7 days. However, I can accommodate different timelines based on religious requirements, family needs, or other circumstances. I handle all logistics to ensure a smooth process."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can we personalize the funeral service?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. I encourage personalization to honor your loved one's unique life. This can include music choices, photo displays, readings, special rituals, or themed decorations that reflect their personality and interests."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Do you offer pre-planning services?",
        "answer": "Yes, pre-planning allows you to make decisions about your own funeral in advance, relieving your family of this burden later. It also helps lock in current prices and ensures your wishes are documented."
